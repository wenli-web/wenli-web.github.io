Wen Li is a PhD candidate in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Chicago, advised by [Prof. Bozhi Tian](https://tianlab.uchicago.edu/). His research envisions a future where drug/chemical stimulation can be delivered through various of ways to (1) treat disease and (2) modulate human perception, empowering tissue regeneration or altering human sensory experiences, such as touch, smell, taste, temperature and pressure perception. 

During his PhD, Wen focused on therapeutic gas delivery to treat [pressure ulcer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_ulcer), also called bedsore. Therapeutic gasous drugs such as hydrogen and oxygen are difficult to generate, store and sustainably deliver to localized wounded tissue. Wen overcame this challenge by proposing, for the first time, using hydrogels as the electrochemical cells to trap therapeutic hydrogen gas generated via hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), achieving a prolonged and sustained gasous drug delivery. And now he is developing smart electronic mattress to further advance the treatment of bedsore. 

Beyond human healthcare, Wen is looking to dive into Human Computer Interaction (HCI), where he is collaborating with [Prof. Pedro Lopes](https://lab.plopes.org/) to investigate chemical haptics. By borrowing parts of human body as input/output hardware, Wen is looking to develop new wearable devices to change human perception through controlled delivery of chemical stimulants.    

Wen has published work in top research journals, such as Nature, Nature Nanotechnology, Nature Sustainability, Nature Chemical Engineering, Matter, etc. He published his leading author paper on Nature Chemical Engineering, CCS Chemistry and Langmuir. Beyond research, Wen is interested with entrepreneurshipï¼Œwhere he co-founded [H-Pad](https://www.hpad.us/) with his undergraduate mentee Brennan Lee, and won $5,000 seed funding from The University of Chicago [College New Venture Challenge](https://polsky.uchicago.edu/2025/03/10/exactics-wins-2025-college-new-venture-challenge-securing-115k-for-innovative-rapid-diagnostic-tests/)(CNVC). Wen won 2025 **Benjamin Ball Freud Merit Scholarship** from UChicago Chemistry department and 2024 **Outstanding Intern Award** from Futurewei Technologies, Inc.

Molecular hydrogen (H2) protects organs from reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage associated with ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury and inflammation. Existing H2 delivery methods, such as gas inhalation and hydrogen-enriched water consumption, lack precision, targeting the entire body and experiencing substantial leakage during administration. Here, we engineer a wireless and portable hydrogel electrochemical cell, that enables on-demand H2 production via hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The system enables H2 controlled generation, localized storage, and sustained diffusion to the tissue-device interface, with controllability and sustainability unattainable with current methods. We conduct the first thorough study of H2 evolution and dynamics in a pure hydrogel electrolyte system, evaluating the influence of hydrogel polymer composition on HER kinetics, gas morphologies, and gas storage. We validate its protective effects against ROS 1) in vitro with cardiomyocytes and keratinocytes, 2) ex vivo in an I/R heart model, and 3) in vivo in a skin I/R pressure ulcer model. These findings demonstrate the potential of hydrogel electrochemical cell design for efficient and sustainable H2 delivery in I/R therapy, which could be broadly applied in other gas-based therapies and drug delivery research.</small>

Colloid-based materials with tunable biophysical and chemical properties have demonstrated significant potential in a wide range of biomedical applications. The ability to manipulate these properties across various size scales, encompassing nano-, micro-, and macrodomains, is essential to enhancing current biomedical technologies and facilitating the development of novel applications. Focusing on material design, we explore various synthetic colloid-based materials at the nano- and microscales and investigate their correlation with biological systems. Furthermore, we examine the utilization of the self-assembly of colloids to construct monolithic and macroscopic materials suitable for biointerfaces. By probing the potential of spatial imaging and localized drug delivery, enhanced functionality, and colloidal manipulation, we highlight emerging opportunities that could significantly advance the field of colloid-based materials in biomedical applications.

[**A Strong and Rigid Coordination Adaptable Network that Can Be Reprocessed and Recycled at Mild Conditions**](https://www.chinesechemsoc.org/doi/full/10.31635/ccschem.022.202101672)

The investigation of covalent adaptable networks (CANs) is expanding rapidly due to the growing demand for sustainable materials, as CANs show thermoset-like behavior and yet can be reprocessed, recycled, and healed. However, most of the CANs reported so far have a trade-off between mechanical strength and reversible properties and often show performance reduction after reprocessing and/or recycling. Herein, we designed and synthesized a coordination adaptable network (CoAN) by crosslinking low-molecular-weight monomers with abundant coordination bonds. Owning to its excellent variable-stiffness property, leading to high stiffness at ambient conditions and low viscosity at elevated temperature, the as-prepared CoAN showed high mechanical rigidity but could be reprocessed rapidly and recycled at mild conditions. After reprocessing or recycling, the mechanical properties of the samples showed no performance reduction, compared with a pristine sample. Density functional theory calculations showed that free thiol ligands played a key role in reducing the activation energy for bond exchange. When used as binders for composites, the embedded carbon fibers could be recycled rapidly and still maintain the original microstructure. The material also showed temperature-sensitive dielectric and conductive properties due to the release of metal ions upon heating. Overall, such performances are superior among the CANs reported previously.

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
